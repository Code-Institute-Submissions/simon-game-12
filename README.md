Hello there,  
and welcome to my second [Code Institute (CI)](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/) school project.
In this project I should be able to show that I can work with HTML, CSS and JS as well as create responsive design which works on commonly used devices.

I decided to follow the given example from CI for this project and create a simple **Simon Game**.

<hr />

## **CI Brief**

- **CREATE A SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON ONE OR MORE APIS**
  - Create a site that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination. You'll want help your users:
    - Select a destination city
    - Find tourist attractions
    - Find accommodation
    - Find bars and restaurants
    - Provide search results in a manner that is visually appealing for your user (by drawing on the skills you have learned in User-Centric Frontend Development)

- **CREATE A MEMORY GAME (my choice)**
  - Build a simple single-player memory game inspired by Simon.
  - Check out this short video and Wikipedia entry to understand the rules of the game
  - Provide details in your README.md of the logic you have used to build your game as well as an explanation of how you tested your logic

- **CREATE A DATA DASHBOARD**
  - Build a data dashboard that visualizes a dataset of your choice
  - Your data can be stored locally (e.g., in a js file) or sourced from an API
  - Visualise your data using D3.js and dc.js

- **CREATE YOUR OWN PROJECT**
  - If you choose to create your project, the scope should be similar to that of the example brief above. If you want some ideas, please ask your mentor for advice and direction.
