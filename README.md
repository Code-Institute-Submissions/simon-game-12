Hello there,  
and welcome to my second [Code Institute (CI)](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/) school project.
In this project I should be able to show that I can work with HTML, CSS and JS as well as create responsive design which works on commonly used devices.

I decided to follow the given example from CI for this project and create a simple **Simon Game**.

<hr />

## **CI Brief**

- **CREATE A SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON ONE OR MORE APIS**
  - Create a site that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination. You'll want help your users:
    - Select a destination city
    - Find tourist attractions
    - Find accommodation
    - Find bars and restaurants
    - Provide search results in a manner that is visually appealing for your user (by drawing on the skills you have learned in User-Centric Frontend Development)

- **CREATE A MEMORY GAME (my choice)**
  - Build a simple single-player memory game inspired by Simon.
  - Check out this short video and Wikipedia entry to understand the rules of the game
  - Provide details in your README.md of the logic you have used to build your game as well as an explanation of how you tested your logic

- **CREATE A DATA DASHBOARD**
  - Build a data dashboard that visualizes a dataset of your choice
  - Your data can be stored locally (e.g., in a js file) or sourced from an API
  - Visualise your data using D3.js and dc.js

- **CREATE YOUR OWN PROJECT**
  - If you choose to create your project, the scope should be similar to that of the example brief above. If you want some ideas, please ask your mentor for advice and direction.

## **UX**

### General Design

Design | Importance
--- | ---
Functionality | 6
User experiences | 6
HTML / CSS | 3

**The project general idea is for entertainment purpose only.**

- create an application which feels good for the user

- **Welcome page**
  - Something
- **Statistics page**
  - Something

## **Features**

Something

### Existing Features

- Something

### Features left to implement

- sound on/off  
- limited tries
- statistics
  - add more colors to statistisc modal depends on the score. Also `sort()` the results by the score
- different themes
- let user to delete profiles
- when loading the game the sequence is played again and this can be used to cheat the game. However, I did not want skip this as after a while user will probably forget the sequence I left it like that.
- limit sequence replays
  - did not add it as you can play the sequence when game is loaded so it can be cheated anyway
- game settings should not be global and I should hook the setting to each individual profile. This way the user can get scored based on the setting

### What could be done better

- error hadling
  - right none minimum to none. Also not enough feedback to user if something goes wrong
- the whole code was tested manualy. More automated tests
- score system is very basic
- load game should show (as soon as implemented) what setting the user plays on
